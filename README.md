### What I learned

Being a beginner at front end development, I already knew many concepts that helped me throughout this challenge. One thing that I learnt particularly from this project is to adopt the mobile first approach as that makes our work a whole lot easier.

### Continued development

Use the movile first approach in more projects to make them stand-out. Also work with some more complex structures
